* Get to grips with RxJS core concepts such as Observables, subjects, and operators
* Use the marble diagram in reactive patterns
* Delve into stream manipulation, including transforming and combining them
* Understand memory leak problems using RxJS and best practices to avoid them
* Build reactive patterns using Angular Signals and RxJS
* Explore different testing strategies for RxJS apps
